# compile-obsidian

> The script is used for creating an internal link on obsidian file with a markdown value of ![[1. File name here]]. It is suggested to use numerical value on the notes since the command is using sort -n. 

Just created this script to quickly compile all of the notes I created and export them into PDF.


Usage:

```
bash compile-obsidian.sh

Enter obsidian folder containing .md: /home/kali/Documents/notes/lab
```
